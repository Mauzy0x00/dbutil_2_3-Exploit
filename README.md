### A Windows kernel exploit for systems that are using the Dell driver DBUtil_2_3.sys

#### Alt name: Dell Latitude 7204 Rugged BIOS update A16.

This is a learning endeavor; as always.

There is a memmove call in `sub_15294` that can be manipulated using the argument registers RAX, R9 and RCX. 
RDI holds a pointer to `DeviceExtentions` which holds a pointer to `SystemBuffer` at offset 0 and the size of the input buffer is at offset 8.
- RAX : From RBX+0x10
- R9 : From RBX
- RXC : From RDI in the major function handler
  
This means that R9 in `sub_15294` is a pointer to the input buffer which gives control of the src/dest and size of the call to memmove.
